# Escape from School Game Introduction
Escape from school is a School Escape Shooting Game. In this game, you are placed in a school at first, but all gates of the school are all closed and locked, you can’t leave the school directly. The only exit is on the school building roof and you can slide down by using the slide to go outside, but all the Teachers(Enemy), Robots(Normal Enemy), and Guard(Security NPC) will stop you from going up to escape from school and attack you. 

You want to escape the school, and the only way you can leave here is to go into the building, kill all the enemies, go up level by level until to the top floor(roof) and find correct Book-Key, put it on the final Door-Switch to open door to free world.
